# AAI - Wearables

This research' results are part of "Augmentative Affective Interaction" project, summarized in the following paragraphs:

>To promote the independence of people with disabilities and improve their quality of life (QoL), it is necessary the use of technological
solutions that enhance their interaction capabilities. This topic must not only cover aspects related to human-machine interaction (HMI), but
also it should span others related to wellness, wherein exercise and physical activity (PA), as part of a rehabilitative program or a daily
routine, are noteworthy examples. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), when people practice PA regularly, there is a
reduction in the risk of suffering from several diseases such as cardiopathies, diabetes, etc. In the past, researchers believed PA was not
appropriate for people with cerebral palsy (CP). Nevertheless, there is evidence that exercise helps to increase muscular strength during
growing and avoid a decline in muscular tone.

>There are specialized centers where these people undergo different physiotherapy interventions intending to improve independence,
autonomy, functional activities, and social participation. In most cases, the time scheduled in such centers for assisting people does not
fulfill the WHO recommendation for PA. For this reason, it is very important to endow this collective with the appropriate technological
solution so that they can keep on doing PA, according to physiotherapists guidelines, in a more autonomous. For that, the use of robots
has been tested as motivating agents that promote the PA.

>It is essential to adapt the intensity of the activity to the users capabilities and control that some physiological variables remain in the
appropriate range. To do that, we proposed to include physiological information in the HMI. This physiological loop can also be used to
enhance the control of the human-machine interaction (HMI) or serve as exercise adjustment depending on the subjects emotional state.
Some previous work of ours has shown how to measure emotions like stress, which is important, for example, to decide or not the activation of the mechanisms or procedures that deal with it and avoid the subject to stop performing a task.

>Comfortable wearable devices that capture bioelectrical and biomechanical signals are required for measuring PA and collecting
physiological data at the same time. External sensors can also be added to enhance the interaction with machines, computers, or robots,
such as those based on computer vision, Kinect, or audio analysis. All these devices will serve to adapt the intensity of PA and engage the
robot to the personal affective state.

>In this subproject our interest is mainly focused on the implementation of a multimodal interface that allows to: a) recognize the affective
state of people with disabilities when performing PA (with emphasis in the group with CP); b) improve the HMI experience by including the
affective state; and c) analyze the methodologies to promote and improve the QoL for this group of people.
